# stig-windows7

This is a placeholder repo. No significant work has been done on this project yet.

<b>Roadmap</b>

This repo will be used to implement the configuration checks required by the DISA for Windows 7 operating systems to be used on
DoD systems. It will also be a submodule of the stig-checker which allows the user to run compliance checks for a variety
of systems and applications that are used by the DoD.
